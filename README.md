# Employee Management System using Java AWT & Swing

The Employee Management System is a Java application that provides a user interface for managing employee details. It utilizes Java AWT and Swing libraries to create a graphical interface and performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on employee data stored in the OS file system.

## Features

- Search and display employee details based on employee ID.
- Update employee details such as name, father's name, date of birth, salary, address, phone, email, and highest education.
- Add new employees to the system.
- Delete existing employees from the system.
- Navigate through employee records using navigation buttons.

## Components

The program uses the following components to create the user interface:

- Labels: Display text or descriptions for various fields.
- Text fields: Allow users to input and edit employee details.
- Choice boxes: Provide options for selecting the highest education level.
- Buttons: Trigger actions such as searching, updating, adding, and deleting employees.
- JCalendar: JCalendar is a Java library used in the Employee Management System for handling date selection and display. It provides a calendar component that allows users to pick a date conveniently.
